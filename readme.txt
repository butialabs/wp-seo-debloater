Hide most of the bloat that the Yoast SEO plugin adds to your WordPress Dashboard.

== Description ==

Free addon for the Yoast SEO plugin to hide the bloat it adds to your WordPress backend.

> **Note:** This plugin is a fork of the original [Hide SEO Bloat](https://github.com/senlin/so-clean-up-wp-seo) plugin (also known as "SO Clean Up Yoast SEO") created by Pieter Bos.

WP SEO Debloater hides (sidebar) ads and premium version buttons of Yoast SEO from their settings pages and your website's dashboard (and frontend).

= Credits =

This plugin is maintained by [Butiá Labs](https://butialabs.com) and is a fork of the original work by [Pieter Bos](https://github.com/senlin).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the settings page? =

The link to the page has been added to the Yoast SEO menu and of course there is also a link to it from the Plugins page.

= Can I use WP SEO Debloater on Multisite? =

Yes, you can. The plugin is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite installations.

= The name of the plugin is confusing, it hides bloat of which SEO plugin? =

The name refers to removing the bloat added by Yoast. There is only one SEO plugin that adds a lot of bloat to the WordPress Dashboard and that is the Yoast SEO plugin.

= The plugin doesn't do anything! =

Do you have the Yoast SEO plugin installed? WP SEO Debloater hides the bloat from that plugin only. If you have Yoast SEO installed and the plugin still doesn't do anything, please open a [support ticket](https://github.com/butialabs/wp-seo-debloater/issues).

= What happens to database entries on uninstall? =

The plugin writes its settings to the database. The included `uninstall.php` file removes all the plugin-related entries from the database once you remove the plugin via the WordPress Plugins page (not on deactivation).

= I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support? =

Please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/butialabs/wp-seo-debloater/issues)
